# React Node Event Calendar

This is simply my very first FullStack project using React JS, Node JS, Express JS and MongoDB. The project has solely educational purpose and is not intended to be used into production envoirment.

Surely the project still have a lot of bugs and errors, but they are nothing but the way through my own knowladge development.
If you are reading this, please feel free to spot my early mistakes and learn alongside me aswell!

I'd also be glad to answer any questions.

Sincerely,
  Guilherme
